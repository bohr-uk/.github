# Reporting Security Issues

At Bohr we accept that bugs do happen so ensure that our processes are setup to effectively address them as soon as possible. However, we also accept that we're only human, so if you've spotted something and would like to tell us please use ["Report a Vulnerability"](/bohr-uk/.github/security/advisories/new) and we'll look into it.
